                I was part of a team that for a class built a graphing calculator for mobile phones.  It can do basic operations, as well as graphing, and also has a unit converter.
                The majority of my work on the project was how we take input, process it, then give the user an output.  I also implemented a data persistence 
                solution and the entire unit converter  - frontend and backend.

                The team has future plans to deploy the app to the google play store.  We aslo plan on adding additional features like support 
                for calculus operations and a more interactive graphing display.

                BGP Python AS Lookup
            </h2>
            <p>
                The development of BGP python AS lookup was inspired by a repository found on Cisco Developer (pyjoeypy06).  
                I thought that the code was interesting and learned of the API it was using to pull the BGP data from the internet.  
                The API seemed underutilized so I set out to make more use of it.  The app works by appending the entered ASN to a link to the api, 
                which then responds with JSON data.  It then parses through the JSON data for the specific information each section of information may need 
                for the given AS.  The information is stored in object variables so the app can store more than one ASâ€™s data.  
                It uses string concatenation to display the result in plaintext format.  
                The project was built in Python and the UI was built using TKinter (a built in python graphics library).
