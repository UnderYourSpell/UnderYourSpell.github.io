                Hi there! My name is Moro Bamber.  I am an American-Canadian Student Athlete at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  I am a Computer Science Major and a Math Minor.
 I am interested in many things!  Some of which include fiancial markets, computer networks, building software, skiing, climbing, music, and more.  Having a backround in
 competitive ski racing has given me key attributes to be succseful in life.  I am disciplined, hardworking, and a team player.  In my studies at UAA, I transitioned from 
 pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science due to my newfound interest in computer programming.  It was something that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted 
 to do more of it.  Along the way I have discovered a passion for problem solving through code.  
               <br><br>
               Feel free to browse through some of the work I've done along the way in the projects section of the site, and there is surely more to come!
