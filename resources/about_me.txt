 Hi there! My name is Moro Bamber.  I am an American-Canadian Student Athlete at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  I am a Computer Science Major and a Math Minor.
 I am interested in many things!  Some of which include fiancial markets, computer networks, building software, skiing, climbing, music, and more.  Having a backround in
 competitive ski racing has given me key attributes to be succseful in life.  I am disciplined, hardworking, and a team player.  In my studies at UAA, I transitioned from 
 pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science due to my newfound interest in computer programming.  It was something that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted 
 to do more of it.  Along the way I have discovered a passion for problem solving through code.  

 Feel free to browse through some of the work I've done along the way in the projects section of the site, and there is surely more to come!
